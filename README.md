## Criteria

Given I need a new, secure password,

- When I click the button to generate a password then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- When prompted for password criteria then I select which criteria to include in the password.
- When prompted for the length of the password then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- When asked for character types to include in the password then I confirm whether or not to inlclude lowercase, uppercase, and/or special characters.
- When I answer each prompt then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- When all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- When the password is generated then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
